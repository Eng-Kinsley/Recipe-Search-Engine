# Recipe-Search-Engine
## Still Under Development. Feel free to use and modify code
### Project Description:
* A web application that allows users to search for recipes based on the ingredients they have on hand. The application will utilize the Spoonacular API to search for recipes, and display them in a user-friendly interface built with React.

### Features:

  ** Users can enter ingredients they have on hand, and the application will search for recipes that can be made with those ingredients.
  ** Users can filter search results by cuisine type, meal type, or dietary restrictions.
  ** Users can save favorite recipes to a "favorites" list, which will be stored in a Node.js/Express.js backend database.
  ** Users can view and manage their saved recipes in the application.
### Technical Details:

* The frontend will be built with React, utilizing npm packages such as react-router-dom, axios, and material-ui.
* The backend will be built with Node.js and Express.js, utilizing npm packages such as body-parser, cors, and mongoose.
* The application will make requests to the Spoonacular API using axios.
* The database will be built with MongoDB, and accessed using the Mongoose package.
* By building this application, you will demonstrate your skills in frontend development with React, as well as backend development with Node.js and Express.js. Additionally, you will showcase your ability to utilize npm packages to streamline development and make use of third-party APIs to build a useful and practical application.
